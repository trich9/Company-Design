# Data/Problem
According to the FBI, in 2022 there were 359,094 NCIC entries for missing children. The unfortunate part about this statistic is that many kids are not reported missing so this number, as bas as it is can be misleading. The NEMC which works with law enforecement to recover children who have been labeled as missing recovered 88% of those identified people. 


Implementation and Strategy
Using drones to prevent child trafficking is a complex and multifaceted task that requires a combination of technology, collaboration, and strategic planning. Here's a strategy to effectively utilize drones in this important mission:

Data and Intelligence Gathering:

--Collect and analyze relevant data to identify high-risk areas and potential trafficking routes.
Collaborate with intelligence agencies, NGOs, and local communities to gather actionable information on known or suspected traffickers.
Drone Technology Integration:

--Acquire and deploy drones equipped with advanced technology such as high-resolution cameras, thermal imaging, facial recognition, and GPS tracking.
Ensure that drones have the capability to operate in various weather conditions and remote areas.

Drone Surveillance and Monitoring:

--Conduct routine aerial surveillance in known or high-risk areas where child trafficking is prevalent.
Monitor border crossings, transportation hubs, and remote border regions using drones to identify suspicious activities.
Real-time Data Analysis:

--Implement a centralized command center where data from drone surveillance is analyzed in real-time.
Use AI and machine learning algorithms to detect unusual patterns or behaviors that may indicate child trafficking activities.
Rapid Response:

--Develop protocols for immediate response when suspicious activities are identified.
Train law enforcement and task force members to act swiftly and effectively in coordination with drone data.
